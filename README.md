# UFOs

## Purpose 

The main purpose of this project was to use JavaScript to build the dinamic webpage that would accept user input and adjust accordingly. 
To achieve this goal the JavaScript was inserted into HTML page and CSS and Bootstrap used to style the page:

* The table was inserted and visually displayed by HTML page
* Basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were used to build and style the entire page
* The attention grabbing header, article summary and brief article were also added  
* The table was built to display the data we were going to work with
* Some filters were added to that table which help users to refine their search


## Results

As a result the dinamic page was created that can be used to find specific information.
For example, on default when filter is empty table shows all of the data.

If user enters the State, for example 'ca', the table adjusts and shows all the data for this specific state.

The table accepts multiple filters at the same time, so when user is looking for the 'triangle' shape sightings that occured in 'ca' State, he just enters them into filter accordingly.

If user wants to search for a specific city where 'triangle' shape sightings occured in 'ca' State, he enters it and receives the list of sightings.

## Summary

In the end, the page has the extended filter that helps users to find specific information in the table.

However, the page contains the static article, that may make users tired of watching if page was used frequently.

To fix that, the extra button can be added to make the article summary and the brief article both dinamic. A user can simply click on it and receive new article every time.
Also, to enrich the experience of the user, the pictures of UFO sightings can be added to the page as well. It can be executed in the same manner as article change, by simply clicking the button.
